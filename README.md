# Use Parcel to bundle UI

Boilerplate setup.

Use Parcel (instead of Webpack or Gulp) to handle

* ES6+ transpilation
* Sass
* PostCSS

Additionally, configure

* IE11 ponyfill for CSS variables
* Eslint, Stylelint, Prettier
* Git hooks

> Note: linter config files use recommended settings, plus some additional personal (opinionated) settings.
